## About Me

I design and build **event-driven, cloud-native backend systems** that power mission-critical financial platforms at scale. My work lives at the intersection of distributed systems reliability and product delivery — from Kafka-based microservices processing millions of daily transactions to PySpark pipelines on AWS Glue enabling real-time portfolio analytics.

Currently at **JP Morgan Chase**, I own backend APIs for a digital wealth-management platform serving 100K+ clients and advisors. Before that, I led cloud migrations and platform modernization at AT&T and Capital One.

## Design Principles I Build By

```
Fail fast, recover faster      —    Design for observable failures over silent ones
Data contracts over code        —    Schema-first API and event design prevents integration debt  
Infrastructure is code          —    No snowflake environments; Terraform everything
Measure before optimizing       —    Instrument first, tune what the data confirms is slow
```

## About Me

I design and build **production-grade RESTful APIs and event-driven microservices** that power mission-critical financial platforms at scale. My core craft is Java + Spring Boot — designing clean, contract-first APIs with well-defined domain boundaries, reliable failure modes, and the observability to prove it in production.

My systems don't just handle load — they're built to stay consistent under it. From low-latency portfolio APIs serving real-time advisor workflows to Kafka-backed investment event pipelines sustaining ~200 TPS, I care deeply about how services behave at the seams: idempotency, backpressure, retry contracts, and schema evolution.

Currently at **JP Morgan Chase**, I own the backend API layer for a digital wealth-management platform serving 100K+ clients and advisors. Before that, I led REST API modernization and microservices platform work at Capital One (Auto Loans) and AT&T.

## Design Principles I Build By

```
Fail fast, recover faster      —    Design for observable failures over silent ones
Data contracts over code        —    Schema-first API and event design prevents integration debt
Infrastructure is code          —    No snowflake environments; Terraform everything
Measure before optimizing       —    Instrument first, tune what the data confirms is slow
```
